# 🌍 Unit Converter

A simple **Metric ↔ Imperial Unit Converter** built as part of the [Scrimba Frontend Developer Path](https://scrimba.com/).  
This project lets you quickly convert between **length, volume, and mass** using a single input.

---

## ✨ Features

- Convert between:
  - **Length**: meters ↔ feet
  - **Volume**: liters ↔ gallons
  - **Mass**: kilograms ↔ pounds
- Clean, minimal UI
- Built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5** for structure  
- **CSS3** for styling  
- **Vanilla JavaScript** for logic and DOM manipulation  

---

## 📖 How It Works

1. Enter a number in the input field.  
2. Click **Convert**.  
3. See the results for all three categories (Length, Volume, Mass).  

Example:  
- 10 meters = 32.808 feet | 10 feet = 3.048 meters
- 10 liters = 2.642 gallons | 10 gallons = 37.854 liters
- 10 kilos = 22.046 pounds | 10 pounds = 4.536 kilos
